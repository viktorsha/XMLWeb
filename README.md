# XMLWeb
This is a web app that parses xml and displays them on a page.

- Authorization and signing up are implemented in the program, as well as sessions to control the current user session and don't give acces to the parsing without logging in.
- Such design patterns as Factory, Singleton, Repository and Service locator were used
- Used database connector and JDBC to work with MySQL and store parsed data and user's data.
- Used Maven to generate a project, configured pom.xml with dependencies and plugins
